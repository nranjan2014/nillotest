DEFINITION
Class:Alarmed
Method:noise
Parameters:vector &lt;int&gt;, vector &lt;int&gt;, vector &lt;int&gt;
Returns:double
Method signature:double noise(vector &lt;int&gt; x, vector &lt;int&gt; y, vector &lt;int&gt; threshold)

NOTES
-A return value with either an absolute or relative error of less than 1.0E-9 is considered correct.

CONSTRAINTS
-x will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-x, y and threshold will contain the same number of elements.
-All sensor locations will be distinct.
-Each element of x and y will be between 1 and 99, inclusive.
-Each element of threshold will be between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.

Returns: 347.99999999999994

   Here there is one sensor, very close to the front door. The intruder can
   move along the wall where he enters and continue to follow the walls until
   he gets to the exit door. The closest he will get to the one sensor is at the
   point where he enters the room which is a distance of 2 away. If A is 348 the
   alarm will not sound, since 348/(2*2), the largest sound level at the 
   sensor, does not exceed the threshold of the sensor, but any bigger value 
   of A will sound the alarm.

{1,1}

Returns: 2400.9999999999995

   There are two very sensitive sensors located near the east wall and the
   west wall. The best path for an intruder is straight through the room. Then
   the closest he will get to a sensor is a distance of 49, and the crucial value
   of A will be 49*49 = 2401.0.
