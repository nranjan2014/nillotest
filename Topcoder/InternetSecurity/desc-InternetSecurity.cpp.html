EXAMPLES

0)
{"www.topcoder.com",
"www.sindicate_of_evil.com",
"www.happy_citizens.com"}
{"hack encryption decryption internet algorithm",
"signal interference evil snake poison algorithm",
"flower baloon topcoder blue sky sea"}
{"hack","encryption","decryption","interference","signal","internet"}
3

Returns: {"www.topcoder.com", "www.sindicate_of_evil.com" }

"www.topcoder.com" is detected as dangerous since it contains four dangerous keywords: "hack", "encryption", "decryption", and "internet". Hence, "algorithm" becomes a dangerous keyword. As a result, "www.sindicate_of_evil.com" is detected as dangerous since it contains three dangerous keywords: "interference", "signal", and "algorithm". Hence, the correct return value is {"www.topcoder.com","www.sindicate_of_evil.com"} since the answer must be sorted in increasing order of website numbers.

1)
{"brokenlink","flowerpower.net","purchasedomain.com"}
{"broken","rose tulips","cheap free domain biggest greatest"}
{"biggest","enemy","hideout"}
2

Returns: { }

No website is dangerous and an empty vector &lt;string&gt; should be returned.

2)
{"a..a.ab.","...aa.b"}
{"a bc def","def ghij klmno"}
{"a","b","c","d","e"}
1

Returns: {"a..a.ab.", "...aa.b" }

3)
{"www.tsa.gov"}
{"information assurance signal intelligence research"}
{"signal","assurance","penguin"}
